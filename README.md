# Tokenizer ðŸª™
Tokenizer is a full-stack MERN (Mongo, Express, React, NodeJS) application built over seven days in a group of three. This project was deployed via Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://tokenizer-nft.herokuapp.com/). 

## Brief ðŸ“ƒ
* Build a full-stack application, building your own front and back end. 
* Use an Express API to serve the data from a Mongo database
* Consume your API with a separate front end built with React.
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
* Work in a team, using git to code collaboratively. 
* Be deployed online
