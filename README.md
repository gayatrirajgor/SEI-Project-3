## 1. Overview
Tokenizer is a full-stack MERN (Mongo, Express, React, NodeJS) application built over seven days in a group of three. 
This project was deployed via Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://tokenizer-nft.herokuapp.com/).

## 2. Brief üìÉ
* Build a full-stack application, building your own front and back end. 
* Use an Express API to serve the data from a Mongo database
* Consume your API with a separate front end built with React.
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
* Work in a team, using git to code collaboratively. 
* Be deployed online

## 4. Approach ‚úèÔ∏è
### Planning 
We first decided to create an e-commerce app as a group. We used Google Jamboard to develop wireframes after deciding on the basis for our app.

### Back End
We agreed as a team to programme the back end components of the project together so that we could all gain expertise, as well as to limit the amount of time spent on the back end owing to the navigators seeing any potential errors.

The back end is a CRUD API, that uses MongoDB, Mongoose, NodeJS and Express.

### Front End
For the front end, we would meet in our daily stand up and discuss what components everyone wanted to focus on for the day. For this project, I worked on the login, register, home page, navbar, and NFT form page.
